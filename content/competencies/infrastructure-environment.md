Residential and commercial areas must be connected by roads and adequately supplied with water and energy. Wastewater and solid waste must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. We offer a wide range of services, from infrastructure development planning to rehabilitation of existing facilities.
Our transportation, railway and road experts are responsible for the quality of the transport infrastructure and any required development or extension measures. This includes planning of roads, railway tracks, bridges, tunnels and noise protection walls – the dominant elements of today's transport networks.

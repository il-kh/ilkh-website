Building requirements are becoming ever more complex, and demand the know-how of experts. Our architects and engineers combine in their daily workflow aesthetic, functionality and economic aspects. They plan and design well-engineered, modern structures and optimize the energy efficiency of buildings. For more than a decade we have rendered architectural and engineering design services for a range of projects including hospitals, schools, office buildings, hotels, commercial buildings and factories. Besides the “greenfield” projects, the rehabilitation and retro-fitting of existing buildings has been important part of our work. The combination of local expertise and international know-how allows us to develop responsive and cost-effective solutions for our clients.

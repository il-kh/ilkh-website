Our building survey services utilize advanced 3D laser scanning technology to capture detailed as-built conditions of structures and facilities. We employ the Trimble X7 high-speed laser scanner with integrated HDR imaging to create comprehensive point clouds of buildings, industrial facilities, and infrastructure. Our laser scanning delivers millimeter-level accuracy with automated calibration and self-leveling capabilities for reliable data capture. We process scan data using Trimble Business Centre, Real Works, and Agisoft Metashape software to generate accurate 3D models, BIM deliverables, and construction documentation. We also provide traditional measured building surveys using Leica DISTO laser distance meters for dimensional verification and space planning. Our building surveys support renovation design, facility management, heritage documentation, and construction quality verification.

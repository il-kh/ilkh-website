We provide comprehensive geotechnical design and calculation services for foundation systems, earth retaining structures, and ground improvement solutions. Our team applies advanced soil mechanics principles and international design codes to develop safe and economical engineering solutions. We perform detailed analyses of bearing capacity, settlement, slope stability, lateral earth pressure, and seepage conditions. Our geotechnical designs are optimized to meet project-specific requirements while ensuring structural integrity and long-term performance. We deliver clear and concise design reports with detailed calculations, construction recommendations, and quality assurance guidelines to support successful project implementation.

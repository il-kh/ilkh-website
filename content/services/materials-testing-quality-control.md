We provide comprehensive materials testing and quality control services to ensure construction materials meet project specifications and regulatory requirements. Our partner's laboratory testing capabilities include soil classification, strength testing, compaction characteristics, and chemical analysis. We perform quality control testing on concrete, aggregates, and asphalt materials to verify compliance with mix designs and specifications. Our field testing services include compaction testing, concrete slump and air content measurements, and moisture content determination. We also conduct specialized testing on timber materials using Mini-Ligno moisture meters to assess moisture content in wood structures and products. Our detailed test reports provide clear pass/fail assessments and engineering recommendations to support construction quality assurance programs.

## Equipment
- 1 Mini-Ligno ED moisture meter (wood moisture content from 6% to 45%, species correction groups, 0.1% resolution)
- Comprehensive soil testing laboratory equipment
- Concrete testing equipment (compression testing, slump, air content)
- Compaction testing equipment (nuclear density gauge, sand cone)
- Aggregate testing equipment (gradation, specific gravity, absorption)

Our construction and site supervision services provide on-site engineering oversight to ensure geotechnical and civil works are constructed in accordance with design intent and specifications. Our experienced site engineers conduct daily inspections of foundation construction, earthworks, ground improvement, and retaining structure installations. We verify that construction methods, materials, and workmanship meet project requirements and industry standards. Our supervisors monitor construction quality, review contractor test results, and document site conditions through detailed daily reports and photographic records. We identify potential construction issues early and work collaboratively with contractors to implement effective solutions. Our site supervision services protect project quality, ensure safety compliance, and provide owners with independent verification that construction work meets contractual obligations.

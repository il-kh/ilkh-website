Our Structural and Material Integrity service ensures the safety, durability, and performance of structures through advanced testing and analysis. We use both non-destructive testing (NDT) and destructive testing (DT) methods to evaluate concrete, steel, and other materials for defects, strength, and compliance with international standards. From ultrasonic testing and rebar detection to pull-off testing and core drilling, our comprehensive assessments provide accurate insights into structural health. This service is essential for quality assurance, renovation projects, and long-term structural reliability.

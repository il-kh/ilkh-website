Our Soil Strength Assessment service provides comprehensive evaluations of soil stability and load-bearing capacity for foundations, excavations, and infrastructure projects. Using advanced techniques like Field Vane Shear Tests and other geotechnical methods, we deliver precise data to ensure safe and efficient engineering solutions. This service is essential for optimizing foundation design, slope stability, and earthwork planning.

## Equipment
- Field Vane Shear Test
  - 1 Humboldt H-4227 Field Vane Shear Set
  - Rapid check of the stability of foundations, excavations and trenches in clay
  - Total range: 0 – 260 kPa
  - ASTM D 2573
  - 1 Humboldt H-4212MH Pocket Shear Vane, Metal
  - Determine quick and efficiantly shear strength values of cohesive soils
  - For excavations, including trenches and test pits

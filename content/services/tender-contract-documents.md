Our tender and contract document preparation services deliver comprehensive bid packages for geotechnical and civil engineering projects. We prepare detailed technical specifications, drawings, and contract documents that clearly communicate project requirements to contractors. Our tender documents include method specifications, performance requirements, quality standards, and testing protocols to ensure construction quality. We develop accurate quantity takeoffs and bills of quantities to support fair and competitive bidding processes. Our contract documentation follows international standards and incorporates appropriate allocation of risks and responsibilities between project parties. We assist clients through the tendering process, respond to contractor inquiries, and evaluate technical bid submissions to support informed contractor selection decisions.

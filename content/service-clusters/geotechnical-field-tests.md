We provide the essential, in-situ data required for safe and effective design. Our comprehensive field testing, including drilling, sampling, Vane Shear, and Geophysical Investigations, characterizes the subsurface conditions of your site. We identify soil stratigraphy, assess strength parameters, and monitor ground behavior (e.g., using Inclinometers) to mitigate risks related to foundations and slope stability. This foundational information ensures your project is built on accurate, site-specific geotechnical knowledge.

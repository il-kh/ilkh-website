In 2016, Inros Lackner Cambodia was contracted by Chip Mong Insee Cement Corporation to conduct a Water Management Study with regards to the construction of a cement plant. The study was composed of a desk study, a field survey including an aerial photogrammetric and hydraulic survey, field reconnaissance as well as the development of a water management concept. The water management concept included the establishment of water demand for plant processes and other uses. The demand was compared to water supply and recommendations were made regarding water monitoring and environmental management.

In 2016, Inros Lackner Cambodia was contracted by Chip Mong Insee Cement Corporation to conduct a Water Management Study for the cement plant in Kampot province. The services comprised a hydrologic desk study, an aerial photogrammetric survey, field reconnaissance and the development of the water management concept. The water management concept included the establishment of water demand for plant processes and other uses. The demand was compared to water supply. Recommendations were made regarding water monitoring and environmental management.

**Scope:**
- Desk study, 
- Field survey, 
- Concept design.

summary: "Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and Geotechnical Borehole Investigation"
---

In the context of a site extension and prior to a geotechnical investigation, a Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) survey was conducted on a surface of about 2.5 ha in the year 2023. MASW is a high-resolution, shallow penetrating geophysical technique which provides images of seismic shear wave velocity below the ground. Measurements were performed on a total length of 3.4 km of transect lines at about 1.600 geophone locations in "active mode" using a 7 kg sledgehammer hitting a metal plate as the seismic source. In conjunction with a limited geotechnical borehole investigation, this methodology permitted a cost and time efficient way to determine the soil and rock stratigraphy of the site, to determine physical and mechanical properties of soil and rock strata, and to determine design soil parameters for foundations, foundation settlement estimates, and construction considerations.

**Scope:**
- Field survey

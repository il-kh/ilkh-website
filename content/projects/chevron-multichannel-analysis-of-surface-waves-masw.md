The ACLEDA Bank Extension project involved a detailed geotechnical investigation and foundation design review for the proposed multi-story office building. The work included soil sampling, laboratory testing, and engineering analysis to optimize the structural performance of the foundation system.

**Key Activities:**
- Borehole drilling to a depth of 30 meters
- Standard penetration testing (SPT)
- Groundwater table monitoring
- Foundation recommendations for high-rise structures

This project exemplifies our ability to deliver fast, accurate geotechnical data and clear reporting under tight timelines and urban constraints.

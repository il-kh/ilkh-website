The new Techo International Airport Phnom Penh is currently under construction and is going to start operation in 2025. The total area for the entire airport develop­ment is about 2,600 ha, making it one of the biggest airports in the world (by land size:).

Inros Lackner (Cambodia) was contracted to develop an as-built 3D surface model of the supporting steel structures of the Head House and the Northwest Pier. The as-built model is needed for the design and manufacturing of interior and exterior cladding as well as for the integration MEP services.

Head House and the Northwest Pier cover a footprint of 12 ha. The structures were scanned with our own Trimble X7. More than 100 trillion (1011) survey points were collected from about 2000 instrument stations. After editing and filtering, the data was processed to a 3D surface model using Autodesk Revit software.

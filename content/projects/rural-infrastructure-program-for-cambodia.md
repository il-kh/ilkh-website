Inros Lackner Cambodia is overseeing a significant infrastructure project in Cambodia's rural regions, aimed at sustainably improving the lives of the local population. The "Rural Infrastructure Development Programme for Cambodia" (RID4CAM) involves the modernisation and construction of approximately 540 kilometres of roads, with an investment volume of about 80 million euros. In addition, a comprehensive road management system will be implemented, alongside further measures in the areas of water supply, drainage, and irrigation. Inros Lackner, in cooperation with GITEC IGIP GmbH, has been appointed by the Cambodian Ministry of Rural Development as a consultant for project implementation. The project is co-financed by the German Development Bank (KfW), the French Agence Française de Développement, and the European Union. It supports the country’s economic and social development objectives, as well as poverty alleviation in Cambodia’s rural areas.

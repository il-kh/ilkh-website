**Project Description:**

The objective of the project is to improve 508 km of priority rural roads in eight provinces to enhance agricultural development and better access for rural communities. This project provides all-year access to markets, school, health centers, and public administration. It improves infrastructure that strengthens climate change resilience of rural areas. Agriculture productivity by small scale investments with local people will be improved as well as the capacity of project partners will be developed in the communities. The project also enhances local development such as community water supply, sanitation facilities, schools, health centers, and markets. In addition to the road rehabilitation, capacity building is included in the project with technical assistance and training to both Ministry’s and Provincial Department’s staff, contractors, and local people in the project villages. 

Rural Infrastructure Development Program for Cambodia (RID4CAM) is divided into three batches. Batch 1 is indicated in three provinces such as Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, and Battambang. Batch 2 is in Kandal and Kampong Thom provinces. Batch 3 is in Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, Battambang, Kandal, Prey Veng, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddor Meanchey provinces.

**Scope:**

The design of road rehabilitation measures for paved and gravel roads will be carried out for the Batch 1 roads identified during the PPS and confirmed in the inception report. The same design services will be carried out for the Batch 2 roads approved after the completion of Task B.
The designs will be based on the documents and standards that have been developed by the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and were previously used under KfW’s Rural Infrastructure Programme.

The services provided include surveys, studies, and investigations in the five following categories:
- Hydrologic and drainage studies
- Topographic surveys
- Traffic surveys
- Structural surveys and investigations
- Geotechnical investigations and material resource surveys
- Socio-economic studies

- Geometric road design
- Design of structures
- Pavement design
The design is based on the results of the previously conducted surveys, studies, and investigations.

Others provided services are:
- Preparation of bid documents
- Site supervision road works
